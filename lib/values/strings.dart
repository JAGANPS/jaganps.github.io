      "COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly affected our day-to-day life disrupting the world trade and movements. Wearing a protective face mask has become a new normal. In the near future, many public service providers will ask the customers to wear masks correctly to avail of their services. Therefore, face mask detection has become a crucial task to help global society. This paper presents a simplified approach to achieve this purpose using some basic Machine Learning packages like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV and Scikit-Learn. The proposed method detects the face from the image correctly and then identifies if it has a mask on it or not. As a surveillance task performer, it can also detect a face along with a mask in motion. The method attains accuracy up to 95.77% and 94.58% respectively on two different datasets. We explore optimized values of parameters using the Sequential Convolutional Neural Network model to detect the presence of masks correctly without causing over-fitting.";

To balance the efficiency and accuracy, the model is fine-tuned considering the nature of the target problem and fire data.\n\nour CNN model. The model contains three Conv2D-MaxPooling2D layers pairs followed by 3 Dense layers. To overcome the problem of overfitting we will also add dropout layers. The last layer is the softmax layer which will give us the probability distribution for both the classes — Fire and Nonfire. One can also use ‘sigmoid’ activation function at the last layer by changing the number of classes\n I have trained our previous CNN model in this dataset and the result was that it overfitted, as it could not handle this comparatively larger dataset and learn complex features ";

Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. Because of its unique advantages in critical features detection from complex BC datasets, machine learning (ML) is widely recognized as the methodology of choice in BC pattern classification and forecast modelling.\nClassification and data mining methods are an effective way to classify data.
